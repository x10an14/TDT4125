Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

5.1:
	Probabilistic analysis
	total ordering
	Randomized algorithms
	pseudo-random generators

5.1-1:
	if candidate i is better than candidate best
		This implies total order, since this would fail if we get a candidate
		we cannot rank, giving us a value to compare with candidate best.

5.1-2*:
	Using calls to random(0,1), what is the running time of a function random(a,b)?
		So call b-a for n (n = b-a). Use random(0,1) n times, and sum the results.
		Add a to the reults, and return this value.
		This will have a O(b-a) runtime.

5.1-3*:
	Convert binomial distribution into something else?

5.2:
	Indicator random variables (Lemma 5.1)
		(Forventingsverdi -formler til utfall X i utfallsrom A)
	Utilize statistics math to get the expected hiring cost of interviewing n
	candidates.

5.3:
	Randomized algorithms
	Randomly permuted arrays
	Lots of statistics math showing/proving randomized permutations.

5.4
	Masse oppgaver med statistikk...
	A.7 er mye brukt i oppgavene. LÃ¦re seg denne utenat?
